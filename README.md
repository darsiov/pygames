# Pygames ðŸ•¹
This is my recopilatory of versions and progress of my first game made with the module set Pygame.
For more information about how to program with the set Pygame check the [official website](https://www.pygame.org/ "official website").

To execute all the versions of the project please follow this process.
### 1. Install Pygame Set
Open the console that you usualy use to execute your Python projects like Bash, Powershell, etc. 

Check that you're in the home, if you aren't go with the next command:

`cd ~`

Now you only need install the set with this command:

`pip install Pygame`
### 2. Download Versions
